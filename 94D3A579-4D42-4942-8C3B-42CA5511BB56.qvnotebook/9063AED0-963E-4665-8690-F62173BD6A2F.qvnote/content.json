From my research in vision and robotics at Peter Allen's lab, I'm familiar with the work that your lab does, and I'm very interested in getting involved at your lab this summer!\n\nI'm currently working on several different projects – including decyphering human grasp intention using deep learning applied on sEMG data (under Prof. Allen), data augmentation to counteract catastrophic forgetting (under Prof. Carl Vondrick), and a more theory-heavy project on embedding multiple latent hierarchies in a fixed-dimensional hyperbolic space (under Prof. Nakul Verma). I've also previously worked in Intel and LinkedIn for research projects in computer vision. I've attached my CV here with more about my research experience – if you have a moment, please do take a look!\n\nI've had a chance to look through your recent publications, and I'm fascinated by your paper disentangling task transfer learning (Taskonomy). I'd be interested in investigating if one can build a predictor for the efficacy of a task transfer based on datasets of the source and target tasks, rather than relying on tons of GPU hours to measure that transfer efficacy. (In fact, I'm working on something similar right now with Professor Vondrick.)\n\nWhile my interests lie largely in lifelong learning, computer vision, and robotics, I would be very open to being assigned to new projects. I'm reaching out to you because of all the faculty at Berkeley, my interests align best with your lab's research direction. If you'd like a letter of recommendation from any advisors I currently work with, please let me know!\n\nI would love to be doing research at your lab this summer. Please let me know if that is a possibility!\n\nThanks so much,\nIan"
