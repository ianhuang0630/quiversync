I'm definitely interested in working under your startup (and will apply in the future!), but at the same time, my goal this summer is to get involved in research at Stanford.\n\nI'm still very interested in getting involved in a research group specializing in Computer Vision and Robotics at Stanford, so would you by any chance be willing to refer me to someone in this field? Perhaps you could put me in contact with someone managing your lab in your absence?\n\nBest,\nIan\n\n\n"
