Surprising that Mask R-CNN did not reference this paper or use a lighter architecture in reference to this paper.\n\nTrue innovation seems to be just a reduction in the complexity of the head, which is permitted because of the relative simplicity (bounding box, instead of instance segmentation) of the problem. Maybe that's why Mask R-CNN didn't use a lighter architecture like was done in this paper.\n"
