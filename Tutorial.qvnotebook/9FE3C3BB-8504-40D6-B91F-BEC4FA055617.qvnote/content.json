You can create a shared notebook from a local notebook, or from scratch. Another team member can then open the notebook on another computer and make edits. This is a great way to build a shared knowledge base for the whole team.</div><div><br></div><div>Multiple users can make changes to the same shared notebook at the same time, and changes to the notebook (adding and removing notes) will be synced. However, <u>Quiver does not resolve conflicts at the note level</u>.&nbsp;This means that if two users make changes to the same note at the same time, one of them will be notified that the note has been modified and needs to be reloaded.</div>"
